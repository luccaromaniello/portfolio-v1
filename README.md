## Credits

A huge shoutout to [Brittany Chieng](https://github.com/bchiang7) for exemplifying code versioning (separating portfolio versions and documenting them). I’ve followed the same approach as her, and I hope you like it. Take a look at her portfolio at [www.brittanychieng.com](https://www.brittanychieng.com).
